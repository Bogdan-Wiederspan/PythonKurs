    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all of the calculations we performed, either with basic python or modules such as numpy, have been numerical calculations. To do this we had to first derive the necessary formulas on our own and then we had to implement the necessary algorithms to actually get the results we wanted. \n",
    "And during your physics studies you will encounter many more situations where you will need to integrate or differentiate functions, solve linear algebra problems or find solutions to differential equations.\\\n",
    "It would therefore be great if we could solve such mathematical problems analytically on our computers.\\\n",
    "And that is indeed possible with the use of so-called \"Computer Algebra Systems\" (CAS). You might have already used some of them, famous ones are \"Mathematica\" or its online version \"Wolfram alpha\". These tools allow you to perform computations in a symbolic way rather than only numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a python package that allows us to do symbolic computations with python: **SymPy**.\n",
    "And in this exercise we will explore the basics of this.\n",
    "We have of course only a limited amount of time in this exercise and will only be able to discuss the basic and most useful features of SymPy. But if you want to learn more you can check out the official documentation [here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start we will need to import the SymPy package. In addition we will also import numpy and MatplotLib for later exercises. \\\n",
    "We also want to have our mathematical expressions look pretty when we print them. SymPy itself supports several ways to print things, from UTF-8 terminal compatible ways to producing Latex code ([see here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/printing.html#tutorial-printing)).\n",
    "The nicest way when working in an IPython notebook as we are is to use the `display` function from the `IPython` module. We will therefore also import that function. **And whenever we want to print anything SymPy related we will use** `display(thing_to_print)`.\n"

Its `init` method has a mandatory parameter `name` with which we can assign the mathematical symbol that we want to use when printing our new variable. It also has a couple of optional arguments with which we can further specify the type of mathematical object it should represent, for example whether its a complex number or a function. Note that we do not assign any values. Since we want to do symbolic computations we don't need values! Later we will discuss how we can evaluate our mathematical expressions for specific variables values. \n",

    "Many non-periodic complex-valued functions can be decomposed into a superposition of simple wave functions with different amplitudes and frequencies.\n",
    "Or stated the other way round, one can create most non-periodic function by adding wave functions with the right frequencies and amplitudes.\n",
    "An example for this are acoustisc waveforms that can be decomposed into sine waves of the various basic frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition can be achieved using the Fourier transform (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)). Given a \"signal\" function $f(t)$ we can calculate its Fourier transform as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}t f(t) e^{(-i \\omega t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an inverse operation that results in the original function $f(t)$ , the inverse Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{2\\pi} \\tilde{f}(\\omega) e^{(+i \\omega t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can see that the function $f(t)$ is composed of a superposition of simple wave functions with frequencey $\\omega$ (the $e^{(+i \\omega t)}$ parts) where each of those wave functions has a contribution that depends on the frequency ( the $\\frac{\\tilde{f}(\\omega)}{2\\pi}$ parts -- they are called the Fourier coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations are very useful for many different applications. We could for example remove high-frequency noise from a signal by first doing the Fourier transform, then decreasing the high-frequency coefficients and finally doing the inverse Fourer transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will explore a special signal form that you will encounter again later in your physics studies: A Gaussian pulse with the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\frac{1}{a \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2 a^2}\\right)}$$\n",
