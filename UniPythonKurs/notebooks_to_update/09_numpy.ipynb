    "The main object NumPy deals with is the Array. Arrays have previously been introduced in **Lesson 3**. While their functionally is similar to standard python lists, arrays differ in three important features:\n",
    "- Arrays have a fixed length, defined upon creation. This means that, unlike a list, additional elements cannot be appended to an array. Any method that does so always creates a new array with the to-be-appended element included. This makes appending elements to arrays slow.\n",
    "- All values in an array have the same type, e.g. integer or float.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays and operations used upon them are implemented using a C++ backend. This allows arrays to bypass the typically slow evaluation times of python and makes array operations very fast. "
