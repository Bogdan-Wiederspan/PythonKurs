    "# Exceptions\n",
    "During the execution of the program, errors and other unexpected situations (such as unexpected inputs) can occur. These errors, known as exceptions, can disrupt the normal flow of the program and cause it to terminate abruptly. It is commonly said that the program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows developers to gracefully handle these exceptions and prevent program crashes, resulting in a robust and reliable software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical situations where exception handling improves the user experience are:\n",
    "- **Handling of program crashes**: Data will be lost when a program crashes. This can be handled by saving intermediate results in the case of an exception.\n",
    "- **Identification of bugs**: To identify the roots of errors it can come in handy to have access to the program state when the crash happens and, for example, to place a debugger in the exception (A debugger is a tool that is useful to debug programs! See for a basic overview [the wikipedia article on debuggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger).)\n",
    "- **Unpredictable behavior**: A program often depends on external data (I/O files or user input) in a certain format. Common exceptions regarding file handling are missing or corrupted files. The program could also encounter data in the wrong format (for example a string where the program expected a floating point number). In this case the program could produce a specific error message explaing the issue. Then it could stop in a controlled way instead of just crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a mechanism to handle such exceptions with the `try` and `except` keywords. The general syntax is similar to `if-else` statements.\n"

    "### Exception handler\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to handle different kinds of exceptions in different ways. This can be achieved by using an exception handler.\n",

    "### Bonus: Help robot Roberto to map a Maze\n",
    "\n",
    "Roberto is a little robot that was tasked to map mazes.  \n",
    "Roberto can walk \"N\"(orth), \"S\"(outh), \"W\"(est) and \"E\"(ast).  \n",
    "He can only walk open areas within a maze, these are marked by an \"O\".\n",
    "The mazes walls are made by an \"X\". There are also rewards hidden inside the maze, marked by an \"R\".  \n",
    "The maze is saved in a 2-D nested list, and one can check a specific coordinate within the maze by using for example: `maze[row][column]== \"X\"`.\n",
    "There are two mazes Roberto wants to walk through, an easy one and a hard one:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy maze:\n",
    "```\n",
    "XXXXX\n",
    "XSXEX\n",
    "XOXOX\n",
    "XOXOX\n",
    "XOXRX\n",
    "XOOOX\n",
    "XXXXX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard maze:\n",
    "```\n",
    "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n",
    "XSXXXXXXXXXXXX\n",
    "XOXOOOOOOOOOXX\n",
    "XOXOXXOXXXXOXX\n",
    "XOXOXXOOOXOOXX\n",
    "XOXOXXOXXXXXXX\n",
    "XOOOXXOOOOOXXX\n",
    "XOXXOOOXOXOOEX\n",
    "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n",
    "```\n",
    "In both mazes Roberto starts on field marked `S`, with the coordinates (1,1). Note also that Roberto's light sensor are currently damaged, thus he can only check the tiles right next to his current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Write code to maneuver Roberto thought the maze and note the coordinates of the rewards, as well as that of the exit.\n",
    "Your code should work for any kind of maze, especially for the easy and hard mazes above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 1: There are many ways to solve this task. A simple, but not the most efficient one, uses a stack pattern. \n",
    "Generally, a **stack** is a linear data structure that stores its items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) fashion. \n",
    "This means that a new element can be added at one end of the stack and elements can be removed from that end only. \n",
    "For example, stacks are used when a program is started or a function is called to store data items (typically local variables) in special areas of memory. At a higher level, one can use Python lists as a stack by adding elements with `append` (add an element at the end of the list) an removing them with `pop` (remove an element from the end).\n",
    "Why is a stack necessary in the case of Roberto?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 2: Each cycle consists of two steps: discovery and actually moving. \n",
    "During the discovery part Roberto looks around (\"N\", \"E\", \"S\", and \"W). Then Roberto decides which moves are possible and adds them to its stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 3: You do not need to check for boundaries, since the labyrinth is built with walls at the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 4: There are possible maze architectures that results in a loop with Roberto moving repeatedly forward and backward. Can you think about a way to prevent this kind behavior by utilizing some kind of variable called `visited`?\n"
