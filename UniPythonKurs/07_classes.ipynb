    "\n",
    "In lesson 4 you learned about datastructures.\n",
    "A very important datastructure is the list.\n",
    "So far we only talked about how to use lists but not about their implementation.\n",
    "There are different types of lists, the mainly used ones are:\n",
    "- **Array list:** For an array list a fixed amount of continuous memory is allocated.\n",
    "All the elements must be from the same type (references to other objects are also possible).\n",
    "All entries of the list are written to the memory block one after the other.\n",
    "Accessing an element at a specific index is very easy, because the position in the memory block is basically known from the index and the size of the elements.\n",
    "One disatvantage is that when the allocated memory block is full, the whole list needs to be copied to a larger empty block.\n",
    "In addition, inserting an element at a specific position means that all the following elements need to be copied one spot further.\n",
    "Python does not have a built-in array list, but NumPy arrays are a good alternative\n",
    "- **Linked list:** A linked list is made of list elements which can contain any kind of content.\n",
    "Each element is linked to the next element in the list -the *successor*- (single linked list) and optionally to the previous element in the list -the *predecessor*- (double linked list).\n",
    "Advantages are that inserting elements at the end or some position in the list is very easy: you just need to create a new list element object and link it to its predecessor and successor.\n",
    "Furthermore, you also need to update the successor of the inserted element's predecessor and the predecessor of the inserted element's successor.\n",
    "Another advantage is that the elements don't need to be from the same datatype.\n",
    "A major disadvantage is long access times.\n",
    "In the worst case you have to iterate over half of the list if the element is in the middle of the list.\n",
    "In case you have a single linked list you have to iterate over the whole list if the element is at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will focus on linked lists.\n",
    "Why are we talking about lists in the classes and objects lesson?\n",
    "Well, basically everything in Python is an object, including lists.\n",
    "That means implementing your own list class is a good exercise to understand lists better and get familiar with classes and objects.\n",
