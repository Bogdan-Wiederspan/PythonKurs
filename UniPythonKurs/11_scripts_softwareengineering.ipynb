    "# Technical Debt\n",
    "The following part may be interpreted as a little \"philosophical\" but its actually important to understand the concept of technical debt and its consequences for the development of projects.\n",
    "Every time you do a coding decision you your project may accumulate technical debt. \n",
    "You need to understand that your project is not a one-time thing, but something that will evolve over time.\n",
    "The project will be maintained, updated, and improved overtime and you need to make sure that the code is easy to understand and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical debt covers:\n",
    "When people talk about technical debt the following topics are typically covered:\n",
    "- lack of documentation\n",
    "- lack of structure\n",
    "- badly written code\n",
    "- code that breaks in special cases\n",
    "- unexpected behavior (bugs)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why does technical debt accumulate?\n",
    "There are several reasons why technical debt accumulates:\n",
    "- Haste: Pressure to finish quickly teases programmers to cut corners. It is okay to say: \"I can clean this up later.\", but it is not okay to never do this. Slowing down your pace of programming under pressure takes courage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Misunderstanding the problem: Many people learn more about circumstances of the problem they want to solve, while writing code about it. It is almost inevitably that some of the progress you made in between turn out to be wrong. Every time you add a new code to correct your wrong assumptions, they will lay a burden on the original design, unless you clean up properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of experience: An unexperienced programmer thinks that programming means writing code. Lack of experience often results in code that is unnecessary long or complicated. And even experienced programmers can create problematic code, simply because they came from another programming language or have a different style.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limitations of your used programming language: Python checks for SyntaxErrors and the most obvious exceptions at runtime. Unfortunately, Python does not notice much more. This is something most of you already experienced, when handing in a solution. To prevent this kind of behavior an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) can be used. More on this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Changes in the environment: Even if your program is written perfectly, it will slowly deteriorate, since its dependencies will change. After sometime your program will depend on very old software with deprecated methods. To stay up to date technically, the code needs to adapt and it would be good to be able to do this without much effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning the concepts of technical debt, you should be able to understand why it is important to write clean code and now we look into how to improve our coding style."

    "- **Syntax highlighting**: This feature show both the structures, the language keywords and the syntax errors with visually distinct colors and font effects. Helping you to spot errors quickly.\n",
    "- **Code completion**: Modern IDEs have intelligent code completion, helping you to fix common mistakes and suggesting lines of code, for example a list of attributes and functions. This usually happens through popups while typing parameters of functions, and query hints related to syntax errors. \n",
    "- **Refactoring**: IDEs provide support for automated refactoring and tools to refactor your code in all place where they are used, e.g: change a variable or function name in all files where it is used. \n",
    "- **Version control**: Integrated version control help to interact with source repositories.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: IDEs have integrated debugger, with support for setting breakpoints in the editor, visual rendering of steps, etc.\n",
    "- **Code search and templates**: Searching for class and function declarations, usages, variable and field read/write and documentation is made easy. Also a lot of templates are available to help you write code faster.\n",
    "- **Support for alternative languages**: Most IDEs are universal and support other languages by using plugins.\n",
    "- **Many more**: Like online workspace, code snippets, code folding, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your personal preferences and the project you are working on, you might want to use a different IDE. Here are some recommendations:\n",
    "- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a very powerful IDE that is free for students.\n",
    "- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the most used editor by Microsoft that has plenty of plugins to customize.\n",
    "- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is a scientific IDE that comes with Anaconda (you will most likely get this IDE while doing the F-Praktikum).\n",

In this way you can also avoid many errors that would be introduced by changes to the code. A good starting point is the [Unit testing framework `unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)\n",

This is where `virtualenvs` comes into play. They create an isolated Python environment.

    "\n",
    "This is a very sensitive and fragile system.\n",
    "In general you shouldn't take the simulation too serious (especially for long time periods).\n",
    "It for sure gives you an impression how this pendulum behaves but you shouldn't expect that you can predict the position of the pendulum and the path it took to get there 1 minute after the start.\n",
    "Imagine you have a pendulum (fixed lengths and fixed masses) the amount of different movements (different paths) this pendulum can do within one minute seems to be infinite.\n",
    "But there are only two parameters describing the initial state (the two angles).\n",
    "You can imagine that a tiny change in one of the angles can cause a big difference.\n",
    "In the first seconds it might result in a very small deviation, this small deviation might cause a slightly larger deviation in the next seconds and so on.\n",
    "After one minute the state of the pendulum is completely different to the unchanged version.\n",
    "The same effect you can also observe when you have some small inaccuracies in your simulation.\n",
    "For numerical simulations you can always expect that it is not perfectly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice example where you can actually see the inaccuracy of the simulation is when you set both angles to 180 degrees.\n",
    "In real live it is impossible to get both angles perfectly but in the simulation you can do it.\n",
    "Now the pendulum should stay where it is but also in the simulation it starts moving after some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to those inaccuracies you really can't predict the behaviour of the pendulum over a long time.\n",
    "For long times this can also cause a different behaviour of the pendulum using the original and your refactored code."
