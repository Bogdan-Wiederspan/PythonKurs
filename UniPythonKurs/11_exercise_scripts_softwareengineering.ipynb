    "Caesar's cipher is a simple symmetric encryption technique that shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 1, the letter 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c', and so on until 'z' is replaced by 'a'. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to implement a class called `CaeserCipher` that performs this encryption and decryption. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class have only one attribute, which is the `shift`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following methods in the class:\n",
    " - `__init__(self, shift)`: which initializes the `shift` attribute, by using a helper function you need to implement called`_shift`\n",
    " - `_shift(self, shift)`: is a helper function to set the shift attribute and ensure that it is always mapped to a value between 0 and 25.\n",
    "   Use the absolute value of the `shift` and map it afterwards to a value in the interval $[0, 25]$ to avoid unnecessary cycles through the whole alphabet.\n",
    " - `encode(self, text)`: encrypts the text, using the `shift`, and returns the encrypted `text`. Only letters should be shifted, all other characters should be ignored.\n",
    " - `decode(self, text)`: which does the opposite of `encode` and decrypts the given `text` using the `shift`\n",
    " - `shift_letter(self, letter, decode: bool = False)`: performs the actual `shift` to a given `letter` and returns the shifted letter. If `decode` is set to `True`, the shift should be in the opposite direction (decode).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following constraints should be met:\n",
    "- Your `CaseserCipher` should only work for lower case letters.\n",
    "- Upper case letters should be transformed to a lower case letter before the actual shifting happens. You can use the `lower()` method of the string class.\n",

    "## Problem 6\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics and computer science, the middle-square method is a method of generating pseudorandom numbers. \n",
    "The method was invented by John von Neumann, and was described by him at a conference in 1949, thus its one of the oldest methods to generate random numbers.\n",
    "In practice it is a highly flawed method for many practical purposes, since its period is usually very short and it has some severe weaknesses.\n",
    "None the less we want to implement this method for the sake of this exercise to generate some random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "- start from a $n$-digit `seed` number\n",
    "- square the seed number, if the result is smaller than $2n$ digits, pad it with zeros in front\n",
    "- take the middle $n$ digits of the result. This is the random number of the current iteration as well as the `seed` for the next iteration (to calculate the next random number in the sequence).\n",
    "- $n$ stays the same during the whole procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "For `seed` = 1234, $n = 4$. \n",
    "The square is 1522756, having 7 digits, thus we need to pad to get $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ digits, resulting in 01522756.\n",
    "Now we go to the midpoint of the number and take the $\\frac{n}{2}$ number to the left and right (the middle 4 digits), which in this case  are 5227.\n",
    "This is the random number we return and also the next `seed` is 5227.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special cases:\n",
    "- $n$ is odd: it is not possible to select the middle $n$ digits of a $2n$ digits long number, in that case $n \\rightarrow n + 1$ so $n$ is just increased by 1 which results in more padding of the square.\n",
    "- negative `seed`: The easiest is to use the absolute value. It doesn't really matter, because the numbers get squared in any case but make sure that the minus sign is not counted to the length of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a class called `MiddleSquareMethod` that generates random numbers using this method. The class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, seed)`: initializes the seed and $n$\n",
    "- `next(self)`: generates the next random number in the sequence and returns it\n",
    "- `__call__(self, n)`: should be a wrapper for the `next` method and should generate $n$ random numbers and return them as a list\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** To get the middle digits of a number you can convert it to a string and then use string slicing to get the middle digits. \n",
    "Padding is also easily done by converting the number to a string and then using `zfill` of the string class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To use the `__call__` function you just \"call the object as a function\".\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "seed = 1234\n",
    "middle_square_generator = MiddleSquareMethod(seed)  # create the object\n",
    "middle_square_generator(5)  # \"call the object\" internally calls the __call__ function with the argument 5\n",
    "```"
